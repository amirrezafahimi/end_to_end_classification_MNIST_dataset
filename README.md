## Classification problem

Unlike my other projects where I devote my time to preprocess, find a good model and fine tune it to get better predictions, in this project, I tried to have deep dive in metrics and resampling methods. Here I try to underestand what precision, recall and and other metrics roll in finding a good model and finding out if model is performing good enough. at the end of the project, I try to fine tune a model to acheive at lease a 97% percent accuracy. download the notebook and have fun.
